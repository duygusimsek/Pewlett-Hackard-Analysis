# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Overview 

### History

By the result of this analysis, the company will be preparing a retirement package for those who meet certain criteria. Also, after employee retirements which position will be in need to fill in the future can be known forehand. 

Because the company employee information was recorded by Excel and VBA, the employee data was needed was available only as six CSV files. To perform the analysis, the CSV files were updated to SQL tables.

To be able to understand the data and find the connections between the information, a flowchart  (a map of the database) was created. With this flowchart, the relationships between the six CSV files more easily were navigated. [EmployeeDB.png](https://github.com/duygusimsek/Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis/blob/main/EmployeeDB.png)
